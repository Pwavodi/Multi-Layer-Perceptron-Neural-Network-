# Pore-Pressure-Prediction-using-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-Neural-Network
Predict pore pressure profiles using Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Neural-Network.     
Nine (9) petrophysical well-log informations (CGR, DTCO, DTSM, VP/VS, VCL, ILD, PHIT, PEF &amp; RHOB) from the three wells were used as inputs.
